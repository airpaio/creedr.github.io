:slug: about

I am Cory Robinson, and you have landed on my personal website and blog.

**Who Am I?**
I am an applied mathematician, and I currently hold a position as a Processing
Geophysicist. In a nutshell, I take raw seismic data and apply signal
processing and imaging algorithms to it in order to produce subsurface images
of the Earth. Other than geophysics, I engage in several other domains
of applied math including scientific computing and software development,
economics and finance, and general data science problems from data
exploration and visualization problems to pondering over machine learning
algorithms.

**What is SciProX?**
SciProx is a mashup of a few words related to my background.  *Sci* represents
my interest in *sci*entific computing. *ProX,* pronounced like in *prox*imity,
can be thought of as computer processors or `nprocs` for those of you familiar
with concurency or high performance computing. *ProX* could also be thought of
as processing as in data processing such as my job title.  So for *ProX*, why
didn't I spell it with a *cs* like *procs*? Well, since this is my own personal
website and blog, my goal is to share some of my own musings and experiments
related to my math and computing background, so I am denoting the *X* as short
for *experiment*.

I'm still working on getting this site up and running smoothly, so please come
back later to checkout more of my content!
