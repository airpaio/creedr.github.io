As a geophysicist, I work with data every day that has its roots buried in
the wave equation. I became quite familiar with the wave equation and several
applications of it while I was in grad school, and the math can get pretty hairy,
especially from a numerical analysis standpoint. An application of the wave
equation of particular interest to me is in acoustics.

Acoustics, not only deals with sounds that we can hear, but in general can be
regarded as mechanical waves that can pass through solids, liquids, and gases.
Of course we can hear acoustic waves such as the sound of a tree falling in a
forest. We may even feel the low frequency vibrations of the base guitar
passing through our body at a rock concert. We can also see an image of
acoustic waves when we look at a baby with an ultrasound machine. An explosive
energy source on the surface of the Earth sends acoustic waves through the
Earth, and we can record the signals of the waves reflecting off of the
different layers of rock below the Earth's surface.

Analyzing acoustic waves can be done by studying the physical propagation
of the wave, or by turning to the frequency spectrum for a signal processing
treatment of the acoustic waveform. There are way too many applications to
mention here, so I will point you to the
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics>`_ page on acoustics to
get a better feel for the history and applications.

My goal is for this to serve as an introduction for a series of posts that I
will make regarding applications of acoustics that I find interesting.
We will start with a derivation of the acoustic wave equation from the
Conservation Laws, and then move into numerical analysis and simulation of
wave propagation which will have a somewhat detailed treatment of scientific
computing, and then finally move into some other interesting applications
of acoustics.
